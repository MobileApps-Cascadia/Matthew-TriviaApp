  1. Trivia has 10 'ladders steps' to win by answering 10 questions right. Each step gets progressively more difficult.
  2. Player A picks a subject for player B. (note, subject matter cannot be picked again for two turns).
  3. If player B answers correctly, then they move up 1 step on the ladder. If wrong once, nothing happens, If wrong twice, moves down the ladder once.
  4. Then player B picks a topic for player A and the process repeats itself with player A answering questions.
4. Winner is the first one to make it to the top the ladder. 
5. Winner gets a win added. Loser gets a loss added.
